## Quickstart

Three steps: install `uv`, point your MCP client at the server, install the Ableton Remote Script.

**1. Install uv**

```bash
# macOS
brew install uv
```

Otherwise, install from [uv's official website](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

> **Warning:** Do not proceed before installing uv.

**2. Add the MCP server to your client**

<details open>
<summary><b>Claude Desktop</b> — Settings → Developer → Edit Config</summary>

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "AbletonMCP": {
            "command": "uvx",
            "args": [
                "ableton-mcp"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Cursor</b> — Settings → MCP</summary>

Paste this as a command:

```
uvx ableton-mcp
```
</details>

> **Warning:** Only run one instance of the MCP server (either on Cursor or Claude Desktop), not both.

**3. Install the Ableton Remote Script**

```bash
uvx --from ableton-mcp ableton-mcp-install-script
uvx --from ableton-mcp ableton-mcp-install-script --list-targets   # preview target folders first
```

**4. Connect**

1. Launch Ableton Live
2. Go to **Settings/Preferences → Link, Tempo & MIDI**
3. In the **Control Surface** dropdown, select **AbletonMCP**
4. Set **Input** and **Output** to **None**

That's it — ask Claude to build something.

## Components

The system consists of two main components:

1. **Ableton Remote Script** (`Ableton_Remote_Script/__init__.py`) — a MIDI Remote Script for Ableton Live that creates a socket server to receive and execute commands
2. **MCP Server** (`server.py`) — a Python server that implements the Model Context Protocol and connects to the Ableton Remote Script

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Ableton Live** 10 or newer
- **Python** 3.8 or newer
- **uv** package manager

If you're on Mac, please install uv as:

```
brew install uv
```

Otherwise, install from [uv's official website](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

> **Warning:** Do not proceed before installing uv.

### Claude for Desktop Integration

[Follow along with the setup instructions video](https://youtu.be/iJWJqyVuPS8)

Go to **Claude → Settings → Developer → Edit Config → `claude_desktop_config.json`** to include the following:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "AbletonMCP": {
            "command": "uvx",
            "args": [
                "ableton-mcp"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

### Cursor Integration

Run ableton-mcp without installing it permanently through uvx. Go to **Cursor Settings → MCP** and paste this as a command:

```
uvx ableton-mcp
```

> **Warning:** Only run one instance of the MCP server (either on Cursor or Claude Desktop), not both.

### Claude Code Integration

In the terminal, run:

```
claude mcp add AbletonMCP uvx ableton-mcp
```

### Installing the Ableton Remote Script

[Follow along with the setup instructions video](https://youtu.be/iJWJqyVuPS8)

Install the Remote Script with:

```bash
uvx --from ableton-mcp ableton-mcp-install-script
uvx --from ableton-mcp ableton-mcp-install-script --list-targets   # preview target folders first
```

> If you installed the package with `pip` or `pipx`, the command is on your PATH directly — just run `ableton-mcp-install-script`.

This copies the matching Remote Script into your Ableton **User Library**'s `Remote Scripts` folder — the location Live (10.1.13+) scans for third-party control surface scripts. The installer reads the User Library location from Live's `Library.cfg`, falling back to the default (`~/Music/Ableton/User Library` on macOS, `Documents\Ableton\User Library` on Windows). If a different version of the script is already there, the existing file is backed up to `__init__.py.bak` before being replaced.

If your User Library lives somewhere non-standard and isn't detected, point the installer at it directly:

```bash
uvx --from ableton-mcp ableton-mcp-install-script --target "/path/to/User Library/Remote Scripts"
```

> The legacy `Preferences/User Remote Scripts` folder (used for instant-mapping configs, not Python control surfaces) is no longer targeted by default; pass `--legacy` if you need it for an old Live version.

Then **restart Ableton** (or re-select the AbletonMCP control surface) so Live loads it. Re-run the command after upgrading the package — the server logs a warning when the loaded script version doesn't match what it expects.

> **Note:** The server does **not** install the script on startup. Writing into Ableton's preferences directory is an explicit action, not a side effect of launching a server.

**First-time Ableton setup:**

1. Run `uvx --from ableton-mcp ableton-mcp-install-script`
2. Launch Ableton Live
3. Go to **Settings/Preferences → Link, Tempo & MIDI**
4. In the **Control Surface** dropdown, select **AbletonMCP**
5. Set **Input** and **Output** to **None**

<details>
<summary><b>Manual fallback locations (User Library → Remote Scripts)</b></summary>

- **macOS:** `~/Music/Ableton/User Library/Remote Scripts/AbletonMCP/`
- **Windows:** `C:\Users\[Username]\Documents\Ableton\User Library\Remote Scripts\AbletonMCP\`

If you've moved your User Library, use its actual location (shown in Live under **Preferences → Library → Location of User Library**), and create the `Remote Scripts` folder inside it if it doesn't exist yet.
</details>

The MCP server and Remote Script share a version handshake (`get_remote_script_info`). If they diverge, newer tools degrade gracefully until Live is restarted.

## Usage

### Starting the Connection

1. Ensure the Ableton Remote Script is loaded in Ableton Live
2. Make sure the MCP server is configured in Claude Desktop or Cursor
3. The connection should be established automatically when you interact with Claude

### Using with Claude

Once the config file has been set on Claude, and the remote script is running in Ableton, you will see a hammer icon with tools for the Ableton MCP.

### Capabilities

- Get session and track information
- Create and modify MIDI and audio tracks
- Create full song arrangements from start to finish in Arrangement View
- Create, edit, and trigger clips
- Control playback
- Load instruments and effects from Ableton's browser
- Add notes to MIDI clips
- Change tempo and other session parameters

### Example Commands

Here are some examples of what you can ask Claude to do:

| Prompt | Demo |
|---|---|
| *"Create an 80s synthwave track"* | [Watch](https://youtu.be/VH9g66e42XA) |
| *"Create a Metro Boomin style hip-hop beat"* | |
| *"Create a full arrangement with an intro, buildup, drop, breakdown, and outro"* | |
| *"Create a new MIDI track with a synth bass instrument"* | |
| *"Add reverb to my drums"* | |
| *"Create a 4-bar MIDI clip with a simple melody"* | |
| *"Get information about the current Ableton session"* | |
| *"Load a 808 drum rack into the selected track"* | |
| *"Add a jazz chord progression to the clip in track 1"* | |
| *"Set the tempo to 120 BPM"* | |
| *"Play the clip in track 2"* | |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| **Connection issues** | Make sure the Ableton Remote Script is loaded, and the MCP server is configured on Claude |
| **Timeout errors** | Try simplifying your requests or breaking them into smaller steps |
| **Have you tried turning it off and on again?** | If you're still having connection errors, try restarting both Claude and Ableton Live |

## Technical Details

### Communication Protocol

The system uses a simple JSON-based protocol over TCP sockets:

- **Commands** are sent as JSON objects with a `type` and optional `params`
- **Responses** are JSON objects with a `status` and `result` or `message`

### Per-command timing (opt-in)

A command that carries an integer `request_id` (0 to 9007199254740991), or
`"timing": true`, gets two additions on its response envelope: the echoed
`request_id` and an `agent0_timing` block with `dispatch_ms` (total time in
the Remote Script dispatcher), `queue_ms` (wait for the Live main thread;
`null` for commands that run directly) and `execution_ms` (time on the main
thread; `null` likewise). Commands that do not opt in are answered exactly
as before - no extra keys, no timing overhead. The handshake
(`get_script_info`) advertises the complete dispatcher-derived capability
list and the `agent0_request_ids` / `agent0_capabilities_complete` markers.
From Python, `AbletonConnection.send_command(type, params, request_id=n)`
attaches an id, verifies the echo, and exposes the timing block as
`connection.last_timing`.

### Batch execution (execute_batch)

`execute_batch` runs an ordered list of commands in one socket round
trip and one main-thread scheduling - the fix for composite work that
otherwise costs one exchange (and one main-thread queue wait) per
command. The request params are `{"commands": [{"type": ...,
"params": {...}}, ...], "stop_on_error": false}`. The result is
`{"results": [...], "summary": {"total": n, "succeeded": n, "failed":
n, "skipped": n}}`, where each entry of `results` is exactly the
response envelope a direct call of that command would have produced.
With `"stop_on_error": true`, items after the first failure are not
run and are reported as `{"status": "skipped", ...}` - never silently
dropped. A batch inside a batch is rejected as a per-item error.

Batching is a sequencing primitive, **not a transaction**: items
execute in order and a failed item does not roll back the items
before it. From Python, `AbletonConnection.send_batch([{"type": ...,
"params": {...}}, ...])` performs the exchange and returns the batch
result; per-item failures are reported in `results`, not raised.
Requires Remote Script 1.7.3+ (the handshake capabilities advertise
`execute_batch`). The timing opt-in above applies to the batch as a
whole and, per item, to each item's own envelope.

### Framing v2 (length-prefixed, negotiated)

Protocol v1 sends each request and response as one raw JSON object and
finds the message boundary by re-parsing the accumulated buffer after
every chunk - quadratic in the message size (~61x the one-shot parse
cost at 1 MiB, ~133x at 2 MiB, measured on both endpoints; see the
benchmark below). Framing v2 sends the same JSON object as one
length-prefixed frame - a 4-byte big-endian payload length plus the
UTF-8 payload, at most the same 16 MiB - decoded incrementally, with a
native `request_id` in every payload for exact correlation (the
MCP-01 echo/timing mechanism, not a second one).

Framing is negotiated, never assumed. The Remote Script (1.7.4+)
advertises `agent0_framing: ["v1", "v2"]` in the `get_script_info`
handshake; the MCP server switches a connection to framed exchanges
only after that advertisement, and the script decides each message's
framing at its boundary and answers in kind - so a session opens with
the v1 handshake and frames everything after it, while a v1 client
sees byte-identical v1 behaviour. An oversized or malformed frame is
answered with a framed error and a closed connection, never a hang.
From Python nothing changes: `send_command` / `send_batch` frame
transparently once negotiated, and `last_timing` is populated on
every v2 exchange.

### Benchmark

`ableton-mcp-benchmark` (or `uv run python -m benchmarks.protocol_benchmark`)
runs a headless protocol benchmark - no Live required: the repeated-parse
framing cost on both endpoints against fake sockets, round-trip counts for
representative composite workflows against a fake TCP peer, and a synthetic
snapshot serialisation model. Add `--json` for machine-readable output.

## Limitations & Security Considerations

- Creating complex musical arrangements might need to be broken down into smaller steps
- The tool is designed to work with Ableton's default devices and browser items
- Always save your work before extensive experimentation

---

## Telemetry

There are two tiers, and they have different defaults.

**Anonymous telemetry — on by default.** A random install ID, a per-run session ID, which tools ran, whether they succeeded, and how long they took. This is what counts active users and catches broken tools. It contains none of your content: no prompts, no MIDI, no track or clip names, no device settings.

**Dataset recording — off by default, opt-in.** Everything with your work in it: prompts, MIDI notes, track and clip names, and device settings, which may be published as part of an open dataset used to train music-production models. Nothing here is collected unless you explicitly turn it on.

To see exactly what data each tier collects, see the [Terms & Data Use](TERMS.md).

### Opting in to dataset recording

Either set the environment variable before starting the server:

```bash
export ABLETON_MCP_ENABLE_DATASET=true
```

…or answer the question when your client asks it. On your first tool call you're asked once — as a dialog if your client supports MCP elicitation, otherwise as a message in the chat — and answering yes turns it on from that point. Your answer is stored in `~/.ableton-mcp/consent.json`. Declining, or never answering, records nothing. If you dismiss the dialog without choosing, that isn't treated as an answer and you may be asked again in a later session.

### Opting out of anonymous telemetry

Set one of these before starting the MCP server:

```bash
export ABLETON_MCP_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=true
```

Or use any of these alternatives:

- `DISABLE_TELEMETRY=true`
- `MCP_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=true`

This also disables dataset recording. `ABLETON_MCP_DISABLE_DATASET=true` turns off dataset recording only, and overrides any stored grant.

For Claude Desktop, add the environment variable to your config:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "AbletonMCP": {
            "command": "uvx",
            "args": ["ableton-mcp"],
            "env": {
                "ABLETON_MCP_DISABLE_TELEMETRY": "true"
            }
        }
    }
}
```
